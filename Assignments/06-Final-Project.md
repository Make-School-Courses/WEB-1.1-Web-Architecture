# Final Project

## Purpose (Why should I do this?)

Now that we've learned how to use databases to store data, it's important for you to practice creating your own project from scratch - not using starter code that is already partially finished. This will enable you to be more independent as you begin your first intensive following Term 1.

## Topic

You may choose any topic for your project. Some example topics are:

1. A music site where users can upload the lyrics to their favorite songs (Resources: Song & Artist)
2. An e-commerce site where users can review their favorite products (Resources: Product & Review)
3. A blog site where users can make blog posts & comment on others' blog posts (Resources: BlogPost & Comment)

Keep in mind that since we haven't covered user logins/authentication in this course, you won't really be able to restrict access to certain users. Thus, everyone on the site can see every item of each resource.

## Requirements

To meet all requirements, your project must:

- Use two database resources, with a one-to-many relationship between them
- Have at least one of each of: Create, Read (List & Detail), Update, & Delete endpoints
- Have at least 5 routes
- Utilize at least 3 templates

| Score | Rating | Correctness | Code Quality |
| :---: | :----: | :---------: | :----------: |
| **1** | **Needs Improvement** | Required sections of submission are largely missing or not functional. | Code is messy and hard to follow. Code includes TODOs or does not include docstrings for most routes. |
| **2** | **Basic** | Most routes/templates are functional, but a few may be hard-coded or incorrect. | Some routes have code that is messy and hard to follow. Some routes do not include docstrings. |
| **3** | **Proficient** | All routes/templates are functional and produce the expected result. | Code is clear and easy to follow. Submitted code does not include TODOs. Nearly all functions have docstrings. |
| **4** | **Advanced** | Stretch challenges are complete and demonstrate an advanced understanding of the concepts presented. | Code is extensible and utilizes helper functions, classes, or advanced data structures to aid in readability. |

## Submission

When you're ready to submit your work, make sure you push all of your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m'Completed all challenges'
git push
```

Then, submit your assignment using [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com).
