The last section's score will be determined by your adherence to deadlines, class participation, & completion of the readings.
- Pass the Final Assessment.
- Abide by the Attendance Policy.

## Attendance Policy

Each student will be allowed **2 (two) unexcused absences** and **2 (two) excused absences** per course per term. An absence is excused if you reach out to your instructor prior to class to explain why you can't make it. If you exceed the total number of allowed absences, you will be withdrawn from the course.

## Late Assignment Policy

Every assignment submitted by the deadline will be allowed **one resubmission** after receiving feedback. Late assignments will be accepted, but if you submit an assignment past the deadline, you will not be allowed a resubmission.

If you have an extenuating circumstance such as prolonged illness, please reach out to your instructor to request an extension.

## Academic Honesty Policy

At Make School, we highly encourage collaboration between students on assignments. Working with other people is the best way to learn!

However, there's a big difference between **collaboration** (writing code together with another person) and **plagiarism** (copying code from a classmate or outside source without providing proper attribution). 

Here are some guidelines to follow in order to avoid plagiarism:

1. If you are looking at an outside source for help, **close the window** containing the code before writing your own solution.
1. Do not write down a line of code unless you **completely understand** how it works. (This is true even if the source you're referencing is the lesson slides/examples/etc!)
1. If your code is still similar to an outside source or another student's, **provide attribution** by adding a comment to your code explaining where it was taken from.

We take academic honesty very seriously at Make School. The consequences for violating the policy are as follows:

- You will be required to write a [Self-Reflection Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140_PHfDh7gu33OZI_caxEtvNzAlAepjnGcbQcXZ-MRo/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on how your actions affected others.
- If this is your first offense, you may be permitted to redo the assignment for a reduced grade (at the instructor's discretion).
- The incident will be added to your permanent record at Make School and you may be placed on a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).

For subsequent offenses, more serious consequences may be considered. For more information, please see [Make School's academic honesty policy](https://make.sc/academic-honesty-policy).
