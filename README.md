## Course Description

This course is designed to introduce students to the Flask web framework. Students will learn language independent patterns that are repeated across many common servers. The course will cover topics including the request-response cycle, server-side templating, APIs, databases, & unit testing, to help students to build the skills necessary to create custom web sites.

This course covers language-independent web server frameworks and patterns in full-stack web design. Students will use their prior knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the front-end of a simple web application, and then will learn new concepts to write a supporting back-end. This course covers the request-response cycle, server-side templating, parsing data from an HTML form, HTTP methods, and using APIs. More advanced concepts include document-based databases and controller testing. Prerequisite

## Class Recordings

All class recordings will be available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v1sNRXbrF7VmKUxK0U-6V8CgXM4zwpvE?usp=sharing) no later than 24 hours after the class session. For privacy reasons, please do not share the recordings outside of the Make School student body.

## Evaluation

**To pass this course, you must**: 

- Earn an average score of 2 on the [Course Learning Outcomes Rubric](https://make.sc/web1.1-rubric). Each section's score will be determined by your performance on that week's assignment. The last section's score will be determined by your adherence to deadlines, class participation, & completion of the readings.
- Pass the 3 quizzes by earning an average score of >70%.
- Abide by the Attendance Policy.

## Attendance Policy

Each student will be allowed **2 (two) unexcused absences** and **2 (two) excused absences** per course per term. An absence is excused if you reach out to your instructor prior to class to explain why you can't make it. If you exceed the total number of allowed absences, you will be withdrawn from the course.

## Late Assignment Policy

Since this class uses a self-pacing model, there will be no late assignments. However, assignments must be turned in by the end of the term or else they will be scored as a 0! 

Exceptions will only be made to this rule for extenuating circumstances such as prolonged illness. Please reach out to the instructor if something like this happens to you.

## Academic Honesty Policy

At Make School, we highly encourage collaboration between students on assignments. Working with other people is the best way to learn!

However, there's a big difference between **collaboration** (writing code together with another person) and **plagiarism** (copying code from a classmate or outside source without providing proper attribution). 

Here are some guidelines to follow in order to avoid plagiarism:

1. If you are looking at an outside source for help, **close the window** containing the code before writing your own solution.
1. Do not write down a line of code unless you **completely understand** how it works. (This is true even if the source you're referencing is the lesson slides/examples/etc!)
1. If your code is still similar to an outside source or another student's, **provide attribution** by adding a comment to your code explaining where it was taken from.

We take academic honesty very seriously at Make School. The consequences for violating the policy are as follows:

- You will be required to write a [Self-Reflection Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140_PHfDh7gu33OZI_caxEtvNzAlAepjnGcbQcXZ-MRo/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on how your actions affected others.
- If this is your first offense, you may be permitted to redo the assignment for a reduced grade (at the instructor's discretion).
- The incident will be added to your permanent record at Make School and you may be placed on a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).

For subsequent offenses, more serious consequences may be considered. For more information, please see [Make School's academic honesty policy](https://make.sc/academic-honesty-policy).
